# Spam Classifier
   This spam classifier uses *Naive-Bayes* Algorithms to predict accuracy of given email 
   * Accuracy Score
   * Precision Score
   * Recall Score
   * F1 Score
   
# Libraries
* pandas
* scikit learn
	
# Process
* Convert Words into Bag of Words (so it will be easy for Algorithm to preprocess and learn from patterns)
* Use Scikit learn's feature extraction method CountVectorizer to convert words into vector

# WHY NAIVE BAYES?
- Navie bayes is suitable for classification with discrete features
